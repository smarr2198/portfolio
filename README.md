# Portfolio

## Description

This is my brand new portfolio that will display all of my projects from the coding bootcamp class that i will complete in weeks to come.
It will have a navigation bar at the top that has the 3 parts of my webpage that you can navigate to in a click of a button. The 3 portions of my website will contain an about me section, a section for my projects, and a links section that has my github, linkedin, and my email address that i can be reached at. The projects folder will be under construction for the time being untill i finish homeworks and projects to post during the class.
