# Portfolio

## Description

This is my updated portfolio that displays all of my projects and homework from the coding bootcamp class so far.

It will have a navigation bar at the top that has the 3 parts of my webpage in a dropdown that you can navigate to in a click of a button.

The 3 portions of my website will contain an about me section, a section for my projects, and a links section that has my github, linkedin, and my email address that i can be reached at.
