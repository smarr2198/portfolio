                    <p> My Name is Stephen Marr. I graduated from Illinois State University with a Computer System
                        Technology (CST) degree in May of 2021. At school i learned an abundance of topics
                        including,
                        Networking, Server Management, Project Management, and Development. While i was in my
                        software
                        development courses I fell in love with it. I quickly realized this is what i want my future
                        to
                        be. I am
                        currently taking a web development bootcamp through northwestern university to jumpstart my
                        career.</p>
                    <p> One of my favorite things to do outside of class is play videogames. When i was
                        young videogames is what drove me to take a career in computers and established that initial
                        interest in how computer work and how softwares run.</p>
